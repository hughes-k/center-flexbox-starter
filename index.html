                <p>I was born and raised in a small town in West Virginia. Growing up in such a rural community, careers in technology were few and far in between and still are to this day, honestly. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p>My true passion lies with music! I love to sing and play guitar, but everyone has to grow up sometime, right? Therefore, I went to college and became a Registered Nurse. I now work in Labor and Delivery and help bring babies into the world.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                <p>While nursing is a admirable career and very reliable, it wasn't fulfilling my creative needs. Which is what lead me to this journey in web design/development. I seen this as a way to get the best of both worlds!</p>
